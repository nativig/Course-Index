 <h2> Reading Discussion 1 </h2>
<p class="p-text"> 1. In "The Programmed Designer" by John-Patrick Harnett he highlights the dominance that tech and software giants Apple and Adobe sustains on the graphic design industry and the concerns on how it leaves designers feeling trapped in various aspects. "Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders" by Gavin Mueller points out the positive aspects of communities of programmers using open-source code to create accessible means of software and compete against tech giants. Mueller also addresses the downsides of open-source code being played in the hands of hacker communities or established companies for their own benefits and profits.
    <br> <br> I would think Harnett and Mueller's position in relation to these two topics would be that they are for open-source tech alternatives and against the industry-standard design tools because of how they touch upon the aspect of control from big companies and concerns about tools and software accessibility for designers, as these both overlap in each article. For example, Harnett mentions the issue of identity when it comes to a graphic designer because nowadays designer's are inclined towards the materialistic and luxe status of a Macbook Pro with Adobe Creative Cloud already downloaded onto it - this pairing being the "crème de la crème" of all setups. With a setup like this being the "standard" it can be difficult for those new to pursuing this career feeling out of place or not taken seriously if they cannot afford it. Mueller's article mentioned that code can be cost and labour effective, prioritizing the need for accessibility. Both articles draw focus on the idea of taking back control from big companies - to get out of the loophole of paying substantially high subscription costs, realizing how destructive they are when acquiring independent start-ups to maintain control, how fixed the tools and interfaces are to keep the users trapped, etc. 
    <br> <br>Capitalism has taken over graphic design so the solution as mentioned in the articles would be to work towards democracy with strength in numbers, building a tight programmer community, designer community, and creative community to develop and use other creative software that is free/reasonably priced and widely accessible, also teaching people how to code. 
<br> <br>
    2. Skills integral to my graphic design practice would be adaptability, attention to detail, finding a balance with the design and the demographic, communication, understanding print and digital techniques, and using the design elements and principles. 
<ul>
<li> Being able to adapt to a client's changing needs or finding other creative solutions to a problem. </li>
<li> Reviewing notes about research, concepts, if an element is aligned properly, if the colour is too light or dark, checking for spelling, if the image resolution is clear enough - there are so many details to watch and a good designer must check over the work/make multiple drafts. </li>
<li> What's crucial is the needs of the client and the target demographic and to not let personal decisions get in the way of the design. </li>
<li> Verbal communication - asking questions with the client or team members to make sure the idea for the design is clear. Visual communication - text, images, illustrations are arranged in a way to communicate an idea. </li>
<li> Understanding print and digital techniques can draw inspiration and are both versatile methods of delivery - e.g. social media ads, magazines, etc. </li>
</ul>

 <p class="p-text"> 1. I think that Lialina’s definition of the “universal user” recognizes this specific user’s extensive knowledge of computer machinery and understanding of how it functions to make a program operate - briefly mentioning UI and UX design. I think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument of advocating for individual websites over platforms because the “universal user” will try to provide a more unique, optimum experience for all types of users. With various approaches Schwulst mentioned, like the plant metaphor, he advises that individual websites take time to flourish and cannot be rushed. This category of “universal users'' can motivate others, especially those in the creative tech, media, animation, or any other art or design field to take up space in the field and branch out from the mainstream platforms that are currently dominating.

    2. The kind of computer user I would refer to myself as is an “invisible user” because I have always solely relied on interfaces to guide/direct my tasks that it was like I was not fully involved in what I wanted to do - or that the user is “fixed” to the interface and not aware of that. Lialina mentioned “the coziness of iProducts” and I related to that because I was young when the first iPhones and iPods came out and became familiar with the interface and stuck in this Apple ecosystem that has impacted how I use it, emotional influences, etc. In contrast, Lialina mentioned the “general-purpose user” who strives to use any application to “achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose” which is the total opposite of the invisible user and made me rethink user’s relationships with technology and interfaces, so that there shouldn’t be limitations that restrict the user.

 <p class="p-text"> A unique example of a pattern in nature that appears to be programmatic is an endless field of rice paddies found in Ubud, Indonesia, titled Aerial View of rice Paddy by photographer Joel Vodell. There happens to be an abundant amount of “rect” and “square” forms that somewhat mimicked a “tessellation-like” pattern. Tessellation patterns are composed of a pattern of 2D shapes that seamlessly link up equally creating balance and symmetry in the pattern. However, the curved routes and unequal forms add an organic, distorted essence only found in nature. It is programmatic in nature as it reminded me of what Just van Rossum described in his lecture about Voronoi tessellation patterns “there is a bunch of points scattered randomly on the pad and the lines are drawn within each “tile” is mathematically/programmatically divided to be are closest to the original point and cannot be closer to any other point” (“Math, Logic, Design?” 50:54-51:32). The Voronoi tessellation pattern shown in van Rossum’s lecture consists of many small "quad" forms that feature both uneven curved and straight lines, creating a complex yet beautifully organic structure. Looking at the Voronoi tessellation pattern and the rice paddies image I did have an initial correlating thought that both reminded me of mosaic tile art with the lines mimicking the grout. I remember making a mosaic art piece in elementary school and being told of the beauty of imperfect tiles and the charm of recycling old tiles/materials into an artwork. That is why Vodell’s image struck me with the vibrant colour and natural forms.

 <h2> Reading Discussion 4 </h2>

 <p class="p-text"> The word surveillance can have a variety of meanings. Initially, I thought of cheesy spy movies, then thought about how surveillance could impact my daily life. Walking into public areas where there is always a fixed security camera watching the public’s movements, used to capture evidence for any suspicious behaviour, for example. Being active on any search engine and as soon as I click on a link, I am followed up with “this website uses cookies,” and feel an urge that my online patterns are being inspected. In this modern age, I would define surveillance as “sophisticated stalking,” as the public turns a blind eye or is unaware of someone or something overseeing and tracking our interactions for an intended purpose. 


    The notion of an aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment because, as he mentioned, “your sense of orientation may be distorted and is playing mind games on you,” and the idea of needing to stay grounded (“In Free Fall”). Steyerl touches upon applications like Google Maps that portray computerized aerial views and how they lose touch with linear perspective. I can recall a moment when my brother has been able to spot himself on Google Maps and that the image will always be in their archive. The thought of the words “surveillance culture” is so vague and bone-chilling. To think that monitoring scenarios like a satellite capturing images can invade someone’s privacy or develop into an obsessive activity.
