    <h1> Me of the Screen </h1>
    <img src="images/natividad_spotifyinteraction.jpg">
    <p> An infographic showcasing my interaction with the music streaming service Spotify. </p>

    <h3> Observations </h3>
    <p> A collective of sketches and notes documenting the quantitative and qualitative information during my interactions with the app. 
        I would document my interactions starting with recording the date, time, and location. Followed by the genre of music I am in the 
        mood to listen to with notes to explain my reasoning. Also recording notes of emotions, thoughts, and sketches made while listening 
        to the music. Tracked artists I listened to, most played songs, and clicks and scroll counts. </p>
        <p> Clicks would partain to things such as: shuffle, skip, replay, play, and pause. Scroll would account for the times I've added a
            song to the queue, scrub through the song, and scrolled through an album, single, or EP. </p>

        <br> The first photo is an image of myself listening to music with my headphones where you can see a faint, blurry sihouette of my face.

        <br> The second photo is my finger scrolling through the Spotify app on my iPad.
        <img src="images/collage2.jpg">
        <br> The third photo is of my pen sketches while I was immersed in the music; just sketching what I thought or felt.
